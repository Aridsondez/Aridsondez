### About

I build backend-heavy systems with a focus on **distributed systems, real-time data pipelines, and performance-oriented services**.

Most of my work lives close to the metal: queues, databases, async workers, telemetry pipelines, and systems that need to fail predictably.

Previously **Software Engineering Intern @ EverBright (NextEra Energy)**, where I shipped production analytics used by tens of thousands of users.
